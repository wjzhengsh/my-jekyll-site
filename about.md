# How to raise a cat?

Want a kitten from your friend/neighbor, maybe even thinking about buying one from a pet store? Just keep on reading!

1. **Find out the cat's gender and decide if you want a male or female.** Male cats can be more outgoing but more likely to pee on things. 
2. **Name your kitty.** You can use any name you like. 
3. **Unless you want to breed your cat, which should be done only with exceptional pedigreed cats and requires a lot of work (including to keep your cat from breeding untimely), spay or neuter it.** The cat will be tamer and spay/neutering decreases the risk of your new cat developing certain cancers. Most vets do not allow you to spay or neuter your kitty until they weigh about two pounds. 
4. **Buy a litter box.** Remember to remove solids (feces) daily. Empty it thoroughly when it smells bad overall. When you have to refill the litter box, pour 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) in. 
5. **Groom.** Depending on the breed, you may need to brush your kitty more often, but all breeds need to be brushed at least weekly. With Persians, it's 3-4 times a week, with Sphinx (bald) cats, you need to give them 1 bath a week (this is because their hair oils tend to build up on the skin). Be sure to look up your breed to see what you should do. Short or medium hair mongrel cats need brushing weekly or so to eliminate tangles and reduce spare hair that would rub off on furniture or form hairballs; they do not need bathing unless something unusually foul gets on them. 
6. **If you want a cat that is low-maintenance, you should get American Shorthair, or any other kind of short-haired cat.** Short haired cats usually only need 1 brushing a week.
7. **Remember to clip the claws every week, particularly if the cat does not regularly go outside where it might wear down the nails with vigorous activity.** Put the clippers perpendicular to the claws. The "quick" (finger tip) of the nail should not be cut. See where it is on light-colored nails and avoid it; on dark-colored nails, cut a little of the nail tip at a time if it is greatly overgrown and the quick will draw back over time. 
8. **Buy cat food** (canned or dry is fine, though dry food will help keep your cat's teeth healthy), a food bowl, and a water dish. You can find a food/water dish in any pet store. Feed your cat 2-3 times a day. You can share little bits of many kinds of human food with your cat but feed it in its plate or on the floor so it doesn't learn to share uninvited. 
9. **Show affection.** Love your cat and your cat will love you, too. 
10. **If you live in any flea-worthy area you can buy a flea collar to kill/repel fleas.** Another option, which your veterinarian will most likely recommend, is to apply a flea repellent treatment (Frontline and Trifexis are two popular options). 
11. **Remember to get vaccinations from your local veterinarian.**
12. **Love and raise your kitty!**
13. **Make sure you give it treats once in a while!**
